# DNA Sequence Classification with Machine Learning and Python
A genome is a complete collection of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) in an organism. All living species possess a genome, but they differ considerably in size. For instance, the human genome is arranged into 23 chromosomes, which is being organized into 23 volumes like an encyclopedia. A human genome has about 6 billion characters or letters of 'A' (Adenine), 'C' (Cytosine), 'G' (Guanine), and 'T' (Thymine). If you count all the characters (individual DNA “base pairs”), it is a huge compilation and there would be more than 6 billion in each human genome.

The aim of this work is to understand how to interpret a DNA structure and how machine learning algorithms can be used to build a prediction model on DNA sequence data.
